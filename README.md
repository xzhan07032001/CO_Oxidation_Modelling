Related code for the stochastic modelling of the CO oxidation catalytic process.
Respository currentlly inclcudes:
1.Integrators for the mean-field and pair approxmations, in addition to the exact methodologies. It is important to note that the implemented master equations for the pair approximation and the exact methodologies are likely to be incorrect. 
2.Turnover Frequency Code for the mean-field approximation 
3.Surface coverage code for the mean-field approximation

the code format for the integrator, turnover frequency, and surface coverage is all the same for any methodology. The only changes that need to be done would be the equations itself.
